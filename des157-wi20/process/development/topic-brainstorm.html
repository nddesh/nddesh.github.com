          <h2>Mind Mapping Summary</h2>
          <p>This brainstorming exercise made me think deeper into each issue and specifically pinpoint the causes and solutions to certain social problems. The main things I focused on were integration and acceptance of cultural, gender-based, racial and financial-based diversity. The internet should be an open platform for all humans regardless of their backgrounds, and they should each have an equal voice among the public. I think this process helped me narrow down the cultural and gender-based aspect of inclusiveness, specifically creating online spaces which allow expression and education about diverse cultures and genders. One of the main issues I narrowed down was the fact that each gender identification is not well-known in the community. There should be platforms to educate people as to what each pronoun or identity means, hopefully leading to a more gender-inclusive environment. All of this can come under the big umbrella of social media and technology usage, which could be censored for offensive commenting, as an attempt to achieve equality. In the end, I think my project will be based on either cultural diversity, specifically with language barriers, or on gender identification with a focus on homophobia, awareness of pronouns, etc.
