          <p>My website is about gender and sexuality, educating people about the correct terms to use to address non-binary genders. For the website, I decided to use a bright but simple color scheme. My initial idea was to use JavaScript to make the background change colors for each section of the page, making the website rainbow as a whole to represent the LGBTQ community. However, this would become very difficult to use in case of visibility and legibility of the website, making it less accessible.</p>
          <p>My overall layout includes different boxes alternating in colors between navy blue, light blue and white. I mainly used yellow and white for text, to make it pop up more than the other elements on the page. I have pointers on a world map, which would open into an overlaying box with information about that specific area on the map. I also hope to include interactive forms for finding resources and sharing knowledge by adding more info to the map. Overall, I would say my page is simple and straightforward to use.</p>
