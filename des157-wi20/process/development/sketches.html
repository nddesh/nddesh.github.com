          <p>I plan to use this kind of layout because the big, wide map across the page draws attention and invites the user to hover and click around the map. The overall layout of this website is straightforward because I hope to draw more attention to the topic than the aesthetic or functionality. I also included a section at the top of the page that explains the difference between gender and sexuality. I think this section definitely needs to be at the top of the page because it is very important to know how gender and sexuality are two different aspects of one's identity. I also plan to use lots of color to represent the LGBTQ community and help promote their inclusion. I also have a section at the end of the page which is targetted towards the non-binary gender community and offers resources depending on where the user lives. This section will use forms and text boxes.</p>
