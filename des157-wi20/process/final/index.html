        <h2>What is gender?</h2>
        <p id="blockQuote">According to the Human Rights Campaign, gender identity is the “innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves.”</p>
        <p>Gender is your personal perception, consisting of many different genders other than male and female. It is often addressed using pronouns like she/her/hers, they/them/theirs etc.</p>

        <h2>What is sexuality?</h2>
        <p id="blockQuote1">The Human Rights Campaign describes sexual orientation as “the inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people.”</p>
        <p>Sexuality is about who you are interested in being intimate with, in a relationship with, or interested in dating. Sexuality comes in many different forms and someone may be gay, straight, bisexual, pansexual or one of the many other sexual identities that exist.</p>

        <h2>Distinguish them?</h2>
        <p id="blockQuote2">Although gender identity and sexual orientation are often confused, it’s an important distinction to understand as it can lead to stereotyping and incorrect assumptions.</p>
        <p>Some people are against the grouping together of “lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender” in the acronym LGBT due to incorrect assumptions of  gender and sexuality. Marginalisation and abuse on the basis of gender identity (transphobia) and sexual orientation (homophobia) are two separate issues.</p>
